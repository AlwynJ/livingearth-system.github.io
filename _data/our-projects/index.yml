  subtitle: "Continental mapping of Australia for 33 years"
  content: "Generating the first national maps of Australia from 1988 to 2020 using Living Earth, with this providing remarkable and insightful history of land cover change for the continental land mass and islands.  The approach utilised environmental descriptors generated entirely from Landsat sensor data, including fractional vegetation cover and annual water hydroperiod, which were combined to generate the classifications of Australia.  The research and development was undertaken in parellel with Living Wales."

  subtitle: "Quantitative land cover contents and map generation through Living Earth."
  content: "Developing a fully quantitative approach to retrieving or classifying environmental descriptors and using these to construct land cover maps according to global taxonomies. Demonstration is for countries including Switzerland, Australia, Papua New Guinea and Wales and those in South America and Africa. Approaches to integrating uncertainty estimates are also being developed."

  content: "Exploring and demonstrating how Living Earth can inform land managers of the changing extent and condition of land covers and habitats on farms in Wales, with a view to addressing planning decisions and monitoring progress towards ambitions.  The project, which focused on the county of Monmouthshire, demonstrated the power of accessing the full archive of Copernicus Sentinel satellites through the Welsh Data Cube and extracting information on changes associated with land management activities (e.g., cropping, forest harvesting) and natural events (e.g., flooding and fires)."
