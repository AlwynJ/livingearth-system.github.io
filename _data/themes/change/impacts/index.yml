Natural accretion is the build-up of land on the beach, dunes, or in the water by natural processes, such as waves, current and wind. Artificial accretion is a similar build-up of land resulting from built structures such as groynes or breakwaters, or activities such as filling and beach nourishment, or also aggradation."
